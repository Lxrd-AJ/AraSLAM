# BIM

Building Information Management (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_information_modeling) . We can use the autodesk playground as a starting point https://forge.autodesk.com 

# Interesting BIM Software providers
* Revit https://www.autodesk.co.uk/products/revit/overview , https://www.autodesk.com/developer-network/platform-technologies/revit
* BIMX https://www.graphisoft.com/bimx/ 
* VectorWorks https://www.vectorworks.net/en
* Plusspec (plugin for sketchup) https://extensions.sketchup.com/en/content/plusspec
* Sketchup https://www.sketchup.com and https://developer.sketchup.com/en

# Nice to have features
* Strong integration with other 3D CAD tools aka "Bring your own CAD" (e.g Autodesk )

# Innovative features to work on
* 3D Mapping tools using cameras, laser scanners (lidar) etc
    * Structure from Motion tools
        * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_from_motion
        * Can enable 3D data capture using readily available smartphone cameras (checkout https://www.standardcyborg.com)
* Replicate features in the following softwares
    * https://www.flyvast.com
    * https://github.com/iTowns/itowns
    * http://potree.org/index.html
    * http://plas.io
    
* Cloud based workstation solution: Autodesk now offers cloud based CAD software to make it easier to get started, it also saves the customer the upfront costs of having an adequate computer
	* Copy the Gitlab CI runner style, where we call "runners" that can run heavy GPU based jobs. This saves the customer the stress of having their own GPU machine. For example, I can buy 3 runners and utilise them for my jobs
	* Use AI techniques to make rotoscoping a whole lot easier for the matchmove software

	* Assest storage: Yeah they could use dropbox and all but nothing beats having your data stored where it is going to be used.

# Streams
